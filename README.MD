If you are looking for more tutorials from Java programming, i recommend you to look at my repository [Algorithmization and Programming Practicum](https://github.com/byte98/upce-bpalp). This repository ends with third tutorial, because i skipped other ones by doing semestral project.

### Semestral project
I have created simple program for selling train tickets called 'JTicket'. You can find it [here](https://github.com/byte98/upce-bzapr/tree/master/SemestralProject). If you are looking for semestral project only, you can find actual releases [here](https://github.com/byte98/upce-bzapr/tree/master/SemestralProject/release).
